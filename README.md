# A basic overview of your project.

This is Web based application capable of running SQL queries (CSV files) and displaying the results of said query

# Framework Used

This project is using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Plugins/Packages used

In the project directory, I have used these packages

1. Tailwind - Tailwind is used for generatting classes for the ui of the application

2. Headlessui -Headless UI is used along with tailwind to create interactive components like dropdowns and popups

3. React Icons -React Icons is used to pick up already available icons. I have only used Remix icons for this project

4. Papaparse - Papa parse is being used to parse the CSV file to JSON so that we can easily work with javascript

5. Lodash - Lodash is being used to write clear shorthand functions, just to keep the code clean

6. React Querry - React Querry is being used to manage caching and fetching of querries efficiently

# For performance

1. Used React Querry to fetch and catch the apis.
2. One way performance can be improved is by rendering only the visible list of a large table by using something like this - [https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-window]. But the problem with that is as the list renders the table cell will change its width. For that, I will need to change the table to a grid layout and that will require some effort. So I have skipped this right now.
